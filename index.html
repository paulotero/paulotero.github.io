            <h1><b>Network Dynamics</b></h1>
            <p>A computational exploration of network dynamics using oscillating nodes capable of chaotic behavior.

                Steven Strogatz offers this working definition of chaos in his classic text <i>>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</i>: 
                "No definition of the term <i>chaos</i> is universally accepted yet, but almost everyone would agree on the three 
                ingredients used in the following working definition: <b>Chaos</b> is aperiodic long-term behavior in a deterministic system 
                that exhibits <i>sensitivie dependence on initial conditions.</i>"

                The following parts will introduce experiments that were run on networks of coupled double pendulums using a custom RK4 algorithm.

            <h2><b>I. Introduction</b></h2>
            <p>The double pendulum is a widely studied physical system that can exhibit chaotic behavior.</p>

        Many visualizations of the double pendulum available on the Internet have been based on two key starting assumptions: (1) equal arm lengths and masses and (2) zero initial angular velocities for both angles. For each of the experiments that follow, the second assumption was relaxed. 

        Derivations of all equations used for the simulations are given in the next part, including the equations of motion, total energy, the equivalent 4-dimensional system of equations, and the coupling model.</p>

        <header><h2><b>II. Derivations</b></h2></header> 
        <header><h3><b>A. Equations of Motion (EOM)</b></h3></header>
        The top point of connection of the first arm is the origin $(0,0)$. An angle equal to 0 corresponds to a mass hanging straight down its corresponding vertical. 
        With this geometry in mind, the position of the first mass is $(l\text{ sin}(\theta), -l\text{ cos}(\theta))$ and the position of the second mass is 
        $(l\text{ sin}(\theta) + l\text{ sin}(\phi), -l\text{ cos}(\theta) - l\text{ cos}(\phi))$.

        The kinetic energy of the masses is given by the following: 

        $$
        \begin{align}
        \text{KE}_1 & = \tfrac{1}{2}m\|\textbf{v}_1\|^2_2 \\
        & = \tfrac{1}{2}m(\dot{x}_1^2 + \dot{y}_1^2) \\
        & = \tfrac{1}{2}ml^2(\dot{\theta}^2\text{ cos}^2(\theta) + \dot{\theta}^2\text{ sin}^2(\theta)) \\
        & = \tfrac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 \\ \\
        
        \text{KE}_2 & = \tfrac{1}{2}m\|\textbf{v}_2\|^2_2 \\
        & = \tfrac{1}{2}m(\dot{x}_2^2 + \dot{y}_2^2) \\
        & = \tfrac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\phi}^2 + ml^2\dot{\theta}\dot{\phi}\text{ cos}(\theta - \phi)
        \end{align}
        $$

        And the potential energy of the two masses is given by the following:

        $$
        \begin{align}
        \text{PE}_1 & = -mgl\text{ cos}(\theta) \\
        \text{PE}_2 & = -mgl\text{ cos}(\theta) - mgl\text{ cos}(\phi)
        \end{align}
        $$

        Now let $T = \text{KE}_1 + \text{KE}_2$ and $V = \text{PE}_1 + \text{PE}_2$. Therefore $T$ and $V$ represents the total kinetic and potential energy of the system, respectively, as it evolves over time. 
        Friction or damping is not included in the model. Lagrange's equation can be used to determine the equations of motion. Let $\mathcal{L} = T - V$. 

        $$
        \begin{align}
        \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\theta} = 0 \\
        \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{\phi}} - \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi} = 0
        \end{align}
        $$

        Carrying out the necessary derivates yields the equations of motion.
        $$
        \begin{align}
        2\ddot{\theta} + \ddot{\phi}\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) + \dot{\phi}^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi) + \tfrac{2g}{L}\text{ sin}(\theta) = 0 \\
        
        \ddot{\phi} + \ddot{\theta}\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) - \dot{\theta}^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi) + \tfrac{g}{L}\text{ sin}(\phi) = 0
        \end{align}
        $$

        This is a system of second order homogeneous nonlinear differential equations. Both equations are needed to describe the double pendulum. 
        The fractional coefficient $\tfrac{g}{L}$ in front of the final sine terms has units of $\tfrac{m^2}{s^2}$. 
        Define $\omega \equiv \sqrt{\tfrac{g}{L}}$. It is useful to nondimensionalize the EOM above using the substitution $\tau = \omega t$. 
        Performing this substitution and taking derivatives with respect to $\tau$ (indicated by primes) gives the following nondimensionalized equations.
        
        $$
        \begin{align}
        2\theta^{\prime\prime} + \phi^{\prime\prime}\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) + (\phi^\prime)^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi) + 2\text{ sin}(\theta) = 0 \\
        
        \phi^{\prime\prime} + \theta^{\prime\prime}\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) - (\theta^\prime)^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi) + \text{sin}(\phi) = 0
        \end{align}
        $$

        The EOM above are written with the prime symbol ($\prime$) to make explicit these derivates are carried out with respect to $\tau$. 
        However, going forward, the dot notation will be utilized in the nondimensionalized EOM. 
        The derivation above critically depends on the bobs having equal masses and the arm lengths being equal, although a more general derivation is also possible. 

        <header><h3><b>B. Total Energy (E)</b></h3></header>
        The total energy, $E$, of the system is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies, or $E = T + V$. 

        $$
        \begin{align}
        E & = ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\phi}^2 + ml^2\dot{\theta}\dot{\phi}\text{ cos}(\theta - \phi) - 2mgl\text{ cos}(\theta) - mgl\text{ cos}(\phi) \\
        & = ml^2\omega^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}ml^2\omega^2\dot{\phi}^2 + ml^2\omega^2\dot{\theta}\dot{\phi}\text{ cos}(\theta - \phi) - 2mgl\text{ cos}(\theta) - mgl\text{ cos}(\phi) \\
        & = mgl\dot{\theta}^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}mgl\dot{\phi}^2 + mgl\dot{\theta}\dot{\phi}\text{ cos}(\theta - \phi) - 2mgl\text{ cos}(\theta) - mgl\text{ cos}(\phi)
        \end{align}
        $$

        The same nondimensionalizing procedure can be performed on this expression for $E$ to give a dimensionless energy in units of $mgl$:
        $$
        \begin{align}
        \tfrac{E}{mgl} & = \dot{\theta}^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2 + \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi}\text{ cos}(\theta - \phi) - 2\text{ cos}(\theta) - \text{ cos}(\phi) \\
        & = E(\theta,\phi,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) \\
        \end{align}
        $$
        Going forward, the $E$ will refer to the expression on the right-hand side. It can be shown that $\dot{E} = 0$. 
        In other words, the energy that the system possesses will never change. Therefore $E$ is a value that can be calculated at any point along any trajectory, 
        and it should not change from its initial value. This fact of conservation allowed for ways to compare the accuracy of various numerical integrators. 

        <header><h3><b>C. Equivalent 4D System of Equations</b></h3></header>

        The system of 2 second-order differential equations can be transformed into a system of 4 first-order differential equations using the substitutions below.

        $
        \begin{align}
        \dot{\theta} & = \alpha \\
        \dot{\phi} & = \beta \\
        \dot{\alpha} & = -\tfrac{1}{2}(\dot{\beta}\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) + \beta^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi) + 2\text{ sin}(\theta)) \\
        \dot{\beta} & = -(\dot{\alpha}\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) - \alpha^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi) + \text{sin}(\phi))
        \end{align}
        $

        A difficulty in the system above is the <i>interdependence</i> of the last two first order derivatives on each other. 
        To remove this dependence, the second-order derivative in one equation can be solved for in the EOM then substituted into the other equation. 
        The result is the equivalent system below.
        
        $
        \begin{align}
        \dot{\theta} & = \alpha \\
        \dot{\phi} & = \beta \\
        \dot{\alpha} & = (-\alpha^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi)\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) - \beta^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi) + \text{ sin}(\phi)\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) - 2\text{ sin}(\theta)) ~/~ (2-\text{ cos}^2(\theta-\phi)) \\
        \dot{\beta} & = (\tfrac{1}{2}\beta^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi)\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) + \alpha^2\text{ sin}(\theta-\phi) + \text{ sin}(\theta)\text{ cos}(\theta-\phi) - \text{ sin}(\phi)) ~/~ (1 - \tfrac{1}{2}\text{ cos}^2(\theta-\phi))
        \end{align}
        $
        
        A solution to this system of differential equations is a 4-vector $(\theta(t), \phi(t), \alpha(t), \beta(t))$ having initial condition (ic) $(\theta_0, \phi_0, \alpha_0, \phi_0)$ at time $t=t_0$. 
        Phase plane analysis can be performed on 2-dimensional projections of this system.
